## Description
The back-end database has been purposed towards e-commerce websites using Express.js API and Sequelize to connect to the MySQL database. The back-end database allows users to create a development database, seed it with test data, and sync Sequelize models to MySQL database. User's have the ability to use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to display and manipulate data in the users database. Give it a try and see how it helps your company power up to the next level!

# Overview

## The Challenge:
This challenge requires the creation of an e-commerce back-end site that meets specific user requirements. These requirements include the ability to connect to a MySQL database using Sequelize, create a development database that is seeded with test data, sync Sequelize models to the MySQL database, and display data from categories, products, and tags in a formatted JSON. The application should also be able to create, update, and delete data in the database.
## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
